{"name":"SSDcronTRIM","tagline":"Intelligent cron job script which automatically decides how often to trim one or more SSD partitions","body":"# What is SSDcronTRIM ?\r\nSSDcronTRIM is an intelligent cronjob which, depending on the usage of\r\nyour Solid State Disk(s), automatically decides how often the SSD(s)\r\nshould be trimmed. The more data you have on your SSD(s) the more often\r\nthey will be trimmed.\r\n\r\nIt is intended as a fire and forget app which, once installed, does\r\neverything fully automated. In fact it is so clever, you should be able\r\nto install it on any linux system without using the package manager of\r\nyour distribution. Just open this script with your favorite text editor,\r\nadd the partition(s) which should be trimmed (as a space separated list\r\ninto the variable SSD_MOUNT_POINTS) and then execute SSDcronTRIM\r\nwithout any option.\r\n\r\nBeside the needed cron job(s) it also creates a man page on the fly.\r\nBoth, the cron job(s) and manual page installation does not interfere\r\nwith your existing distribution. And if you want to get rid of this\r\nscript just start it with the deinstall option and it will remove any\r\ncron job(s) and the man page.\r\n\r\n# How to install SSDcronTRIM ?\r\nJust follow these five simple steps:\r\n * Make sure you are working as the `root` user on your system.\r\n * Download the latest version from github.\r\n  * `wget https://raw.github.com/chmatse/SSDcronTRIM/master/SSDcronTRIM`\r\n * Set the Permissions so that only the root user can execute this script.\r\n  * `chmod 740 SSDcronTRIM`\r\n * Open SSDcronTRIM with your favorite Editor and change the variables in the settings (Don't worry, there are only a hand full of them!) section according to your needs.\r\n * Just execute the script and the magic will start ;-)\r\n  * `./SSDcronTRIM`\r\n\r\n# How can i unistall everything?\r\nJust type `./SSDcronTRIM -d` and every cronjob installed by SSDcronTRIM together with the manpage will be removed.\r\n\r\n# Is it that simple?\r\nYes, try it out!\r\n***\r\n\r\nSSDcronTRIM Copyright 2014 Matthias Egger","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
